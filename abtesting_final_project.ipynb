    "# Experiment Overview: Free Trial Screener\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of this experiment, Udacity courses currently have two options on the course overview page: \"start free trial\", and \"access course materials\". If the student clicks \"start free trial\", they will be asked to enter their credit card information, and then they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course. After 14 days, they will automatically be charged unless they cancel first. If the student clicks \"access course materials\", they will be able to view the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive coaching support or a verified certificate, and they will not submit their final project for feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the experiment, Udacity tested a **change** where if the student clicked \"start free trial\", they were asked **how much time they had available to devote to the course**. If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. If they indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear indicating that Udacity courses usually require a greater time commitment for successful completion, and suggesting that the student might like to access the course materials for free. At this point, the student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access the course materials for free instead. This screenshot below shows what the experiment looks like.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **hypothesis** was that this might set clearer expectations for students upfront, thus **reducing the number of frustrated students who left the free trial** because they didn't have enough time —**without significantly reducing the number of students to continue past the free trial and eventually complete the course**. If this hypothesis held true, Udacity could improve the overall student experience and improve coaches' capacity to support students who are likely to complete the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **unit of diversion is a cookie**, although if the student enrolls in the free trial, they are tracked by user-id from that point forward. The same user-id cannot enroll in the free trial twice. For users that do not enroll, their user-id is not tracked in the experiment, even if they were signed in when they visited the course overview page."

    "## Metric Choice\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several metrics that can be chosen. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**:\n",
    "* Any place \"unique cookies\" are mentioned, the uniqueness is determined by day. (That is, the same cookie visiting on different days would be counted twice.)\n",
    "\n",
    "* User-ids are automatically unique since the site does not allow the same user-id to enroll twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition and practical significance boundaries (in absolute changes) are given as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of cookies: That is, number of unique cookies to view the course overview page. ($d_{min}=3000$)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of user-ids: That is, number of users who enroll in the free trial. ($d_{min}=50$)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of clicks: That is, number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button (which happens before the free trial screener is trigger). ($d_{min}=240$)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Click-through-probability: That is, number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button divided by number of unique cookies to view the course overview page. ($d_{min}=0.01$)\n",

    "\n",
    "- Retention: That is, number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by number of user-ids to complete checkout. ($d_{min}=0.01$)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Net conversion: That is, number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by the number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button. ($d_{min}=0.0075$)\n",

    "Number of cookies is recorded when users arrive at Udacity course overview page. It is not affected by the experiment which happens later. In addition, as unit of diversion, this metric is expected to be roughly evenly distributed among experiment and control group.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Number of clicks** (# unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button)\n",
    "\n",

    "If the hypothesis holds, gross conversion should be lower in experiment group. (Some users are persuaded not to take the free trial)\n",

    "2. **Retention** (# user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary and thus make payment/# user-ids to enroll in free trial)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the hypothesis holds, gross conversion should be higher in experiment group. (The trial screener filters out the users who don't have enough time commitment, thus the remaining ones are more likely to complete the whole course and thus pay for the course)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Net conversion** (# user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary and thus make payment/# unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the hypothesis holds, the net conversion should be higher in experiment group. (The trial screener should filter out some students who don't have enought study time, thus the probability of remaining enrolled past the 14-day boundary should be higher in experiment group.)"

    "\n",
    "The analysis showed that a statistically and practically signficant decrease in **gross conversion** was observed but with no significant differences in **net conversion**. This translates to a decrease in enrollment not coupled to an increase in students staying for the requisite 14 days to trigger payment. Considering this, my recomendation is **not to launch**, at least before conducting follow-up experiments."

    "# Follow-Up Experiment: How to Reduce Early Cancellations\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of \"early cancellation\" is that students quit the course within 14-days of free trial. An early cancellation is likely to be causued by frustration. However, the reason why students are frustrated is not necessarily concerning with time commitment. It could be not matching students' pre-mastered knowledge, or not matching students' learning expectation. There are two timepoints to implement strategy to reduce early cancellations, (a) pre-enrollment, (b) post-enrollment & pre-payment.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the experiment of asking time commitment, it is a strategy implemented pre-enrollment. This experiment only focused on the time commitment to the class and did not address other reasons why a student might become frustrated and cancel early. Even if the student was sincere in their response and dilligent in their study, they may become frustrated if they don't have the suggested pre-requisite skills. That is, their committed time may not be enough if they don't come in with the pre-requisite skill set. Adding a checklist of pre-requisite skills to the popup regarding time commitment may be informative. The setup of the new experiment should be the same as the one asking time commitment, except that a checklist is added before enrollment. Similarly, **gross conversion** is expected to be significantly smaller and **net conversion** is expected to be significantly larger in experiment group. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For post-enrollment & pre-payment strategy, a reasonable approach would be to employ peer coaching/guidance by means of team formation so that the use of additional coaching resources is minimized while the original intent of the intervention could be best met. More specific, if a student has a team of other students which they could consult, discuss coursework with, they may be more likely to stick out the growing pains and stay for the long term.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Set up**\n",
    "\n",
    "Enrolled students will be randomly assigned to a control group in which they are not funnelled into a team, or an experiment group in which they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis**\n",

    "Participation in a team will not increase the number of students enrolled beyond the 14-day free trial by a significant amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unit of diversion**\n",
    "\n",
    "The unit of diversion will be **user-id** as the change takes place after a student creates an account and enrolls in a course.\n",

    "Retention. A statistically and practically significant increase in retention would indicate that the change is succesful.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a statistically and practically signifcant positive change in **retention** is observed, assuming an acceptable impact on overall Udacity resources (setting up and maintaining teams will require resource use), the experiment will be launched."
