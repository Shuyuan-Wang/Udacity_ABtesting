Course details can be found here https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud257.

## Final Project

The final project is an actual experiment that was run by Udacity. The specific numbers have been changed, but the patterns have not. 
In the project, I fleshed the experiment idea out into a fully defined design, analyzed the results, and proposed a high-level follow-on experiment. 
To have more details, please see the project instructions.

The analysis part of the project was done by Python and online calculator https://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/sample-size.html.
